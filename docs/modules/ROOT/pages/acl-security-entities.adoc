= ACL security entities

The `SpringSecurityAclModule` packs a domain model for ACL security entities.  These are abstract database entities
that serve no other purpose than attaching an ACL to them.  They optionally take another security entity as parent,
whose ACL will then also be the parent ACL.

The ACL security entity hierarchy exactly represents the backing ACL hierarchy.  ACL security entities are usually
only developer managed and by default require the *acl take ownership* permissions to manage them through the
administrative interface.

The standard `UserModule` provides a default installation of security entities, and sets the *system* security entity
for the default parent ACL.
