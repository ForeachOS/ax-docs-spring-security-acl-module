= SpringSecurityAclModule

The `SpringSecurityAclModule` enables Access Control Lists for managing permissions.  The core service for working
with the ACLs is the `AclSecurityService` and supports management of ACLs attached to `IdBasedEntity` instances,
seamlessly integrating with other standard modules.

ACLs define which security entities have access to a certain object or type through the use of Access Control Entries (ACE).
An ACE defines access for a single <<known-acl-permissions,acl permission>> for a certain `Sid`, which represents the security entity.
{module-name} provides an `Sid` implementation for working with `GrantedAuthority` and `SecurityPrincipal`, which are `GrantedAuthoritySid` and `SecurityPrincipalSid` respectively.
When creating an ACL, the current authentication will be set as it's owner and will be the default manager of the ACL for that object.
